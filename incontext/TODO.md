# TODO

- [x] Only admin can manage master lists
- [x] Admin can manage all admin-created master lists and master agents
- [ ] Master list and master agent views show the creator name
- [ ] You can create a (tethered) list off a master as a copy with an option to restore defaults
- [ ] Restoring defaults will:
	- [ ] ensure that the master data exists, replacing/restoring edited data (i.e. the top-left of the list gets overwritten e.g. renamed columns i.e. position of column matters)
	- [ ] Keep additional columns and rows created in addition to the master data so maybe it just gets pushed to the right.
