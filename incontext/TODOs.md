# TODOs

[ ] Only admin can manage master lists
[ ] You can create a (tethered) list off a master as a copy with an option to restore defaults
[ ] Restoring defaults will:
	[ ] ensure that the master data exists, replacing edited data where possible (i.e. the top-left of the list gets overwritten e.g. renamed columns i.e. position of column matters)
	[ ] Keep additional columns and rows created in addition to the master data
